      Welcome to our <strong>Demo Bookstore</strong>. This is a just a frontend demonstration with no backend or persistent database.
      Feel free to edit, add or delete anything you like - the data is kept in <strong>your browsers memory</strong> only and will not be shared with others.
      If you leave the page all changes are lost!
      <br>
      <br>
      So don't be scared - go crazy :)

      Since this is a playground different pages are implemented differently:
      <br>
      LibraryComponent and YourBooksListComponent are fully "reactive" by embracing the full power of RXJS (e.g. combining streams with combineLatest) and
      async pipe
      <br>
      Other smart components may materialize data directly or use a mix of the two.
