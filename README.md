# Demo Bookstore

A bookstore implemented in different front-end technologies (Angular / React / Vue)

### install packages with npm
use `npm install` from the React subfolder first.
This is necessary because the shared code is in the React folder because of laziness :).
After that you can build the Angular / Vue project with `npm install` from their folders.

### start the dev servers
call `npm run start` from one of the subfolders\
The React frontend is display under http://localhost:3002 \
The Angular frontend is display under http://localhost:3001 \
The Vue frontend is display under http://localhost:3000

### build the applications
call ´npm run build´ from one of the subfolders
